    One week in
  we let the story begin
  We're going out
  on our first date
  You and me are thrifty
  So go all you can eat
  Fill up your bag
  and I fill up a plate
  We talk for hours
  and hours about
  the sweet and the sour
  And how your family's doing ok
  leave and get in a taxi
  then kiss in the backseat
  Tell the driver
  make the radio play
  and I'm singing like <br>
  Girl you know I want your love
  Your love was handmade
  for somebody like me
  Come on now follow my lead
  I may be crazy don't mind me
  Say boy
  let's not talk too much
  Grab on my waist and
  put that body on me
  Come on now follow my lead
  Come come on now
  follow my lead
  </p>
