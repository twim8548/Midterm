    The club isn't the best place
to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends
at the table doing shots
drinking fast
and then we talk slow
you come over and start up
a conversation with
just me and trust me
I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand stop
put van the man on the jukebox
and then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like <br>
Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade
for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy don't mind me
Say boy
let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and
put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now
follow my lead
